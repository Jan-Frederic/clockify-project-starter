# clockify-project-starter
This repo adds project time entries to your clockify account.

1. rename the "examples" folder to "dist" just to ignore it for vcs
2. install via pip: requests, datetime
3. get api_key, project_id, workspace_id, user_id from clockify (hidden in the network log of your browser devtools by visiting the time entries of clockify)
4. create links to the batch files whereever you need it
5. (optional): use the "start_working" in your autostart folder
